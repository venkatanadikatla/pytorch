        "The dataset consists of annual death counts from five causes for the age group 25–34 over five years (2018–2022). These causes are:\n",
        "\n",

        "**Why Gibbs Sampling:**\n",
        "Gibbs sampling is a special case of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm used for Bayesian inference, particularly when the full conditional distributions of the variables in a model can be easily sampled.\n",
        "\n",
        "**a. Separate Model:** In a separate model, we treat each group or data source independently. When using Gibbs sampling here, each group's parameters are sampled independently from their respective conditional distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Specific to the model:**  Sample the parameters for each cause of death independently. Each death cause has its own parameters, which could lead to high variability in small samples.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**b. Pooled Model:** In a pooled model, the data from different groups are combined (or \"pooled\") and treated as if they came from a single distribution. Gibbs sampling in this model would sample the parameters from a single conditional distribution across all data. This reduces variance but may miss group-specific effects, assuming all groups are homogenous.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Specific to the model:**  Pooled Model (Gibbs): Sample from a common parameter for all causes, assuming homogeneity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**c. Hierarchical Model** (or Partially Pooled Model): In hierarchical models, group-level parameters (for individual groups) are treated as random variables drawn from a higher-level (hyperparameter) distribution. Gibbs sampling here involves sampling both the group-level parameters and the hyperparameters in a conditional step-by-step process. This approach balances between separate and pooled models, allowing group-specific variability while sharing information across groups.\n",
